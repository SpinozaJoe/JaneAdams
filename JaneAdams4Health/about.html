                <p>
                    From an early age I have always had an interest in food and helping people. This initially led me to study a degree in Hotel and Catering Management which then led onto a career in Accountancy. However, after having my first two children I became increasingly aware of what I was feeding them and also what chemicals I was using around the house and the potential harm that a poor diet and toxic load could have on our health. Not wanting to go back to Accountancy work I initially began attending some talks by a local Nutritional Therapist who had studied with the College of Naturopathic Medicine (CNM). I was so interested in the information she was sharing regarding the powerful effect that food can have on our health, I decided that I would like to retrain as a Nutritional Therapist. However it was only after I lost my Father to bowel cancer that I finally decided the time was right and that what I wanted to do was help people to improved health. So in 2012 I started studying with CNM. It was a tough 3 years but I loved every minute of it and I proudly received my diploma in October 2015.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I strongly believe that prevention is better than cure and that food and lifestyle choices can have a massive influence on your health whether that be negative or positive depending on the choices made. I also believe that a holistic approach is best for overall health. I therefore look at how the different organs and systems in our bodies interconnect and influence each other. It is for this reason that I chose to become a Tropic Skincare Ambassador; promoting natural plant based products alongside my nutrition to optimise not only skin health but overall health too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am excited at what the future may hold for you so let me support you with whatever health issues you may have. If you don’t have any and would like to stay healthy let me advise you on the best way you can do this.

                    <p>
                        Our child did not have the understanding they needed to become an elite athlete, nutrition is a key element of this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jane Adams had a number of sessions with them to understand how they felt about food, what they liked/disliked etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She then explained how the body uses different types of food and what is essential at particular times of day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We as a family then went over the expected training schedule 4/5 times a week plus competitions every month etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It became evident as we left our child with Jane to discuss their food consumption habits a light went on in their mind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We then decided as a group that our child would commence trying a new range of food to enlarge their taste and nutrition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There was a great sense of achievement when our child would try other food and reduce the intake of sugar based food.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jane Adams has helped our child to grow in the knowledge that consuming a little sugar but the correct nutrition is best.

                        Jane Adams, Nutritional Therapist, introduced me to foods that I had never
                        eaten, starting me on a food journey of discovery, which was not only
                        interesting but benefited my health and wellbeing. As a result of well planned,
                        nutritional eating, we managed to eliminate elements of ill health that had
                        bothered me for many years. And as a bonus, lost some weight.  It was good to
                        take time with Jane to discuss lifestyle, eating habits and think about my
                        health and future.  Having established healthy eating habits, I have continued
                        to do so since our initial meeting nearly 2yrs ago.  It is so easy to fall into
                        bad habits, and not nourish our bodies as well as we can, and so helpful for
                        someone like Jane, to help get you ‘on track’ to reach maximum health.
