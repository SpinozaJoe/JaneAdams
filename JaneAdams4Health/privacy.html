                </p><p>
                    Jane Adams Registered Nutritional Therapist provides nutritional therapy services to clients to improve their health through diet and lifestyle interventions.  I focus on preventative healthcare, the optimisation of physical and mental health and chronic health conditions.  Through nutritional therapy consultations, dietary and lifestyle analysis and biochemical testing, I aim to understand the underlying causes of your health issues which I will seek to address through personalised dietary therapy, nutraceutical prescription (supplements) and lifestyle advice.
                    Jane Adams Registered Nutritionist also undertakes workshops and educational talks in order to educate attendees with general nutritional, wellness and supplemental knowledge to support any desire they may have to improve health and wellbeing.

                    This may include the following information:

                <p>
                    We use this information in order to provide you with direct healthcare.  This means that the legal basis of our holding your personal data is for legitimate interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following completion of your healthcare we retain your personal data for the period defined by our professional association BANT and registrant body; The Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council.  This enables us to process any complaint you may make.  In this case the legal basis of our holding your personal data is for contract administration.

                </p>
                <p>
                    We may obtain sensitive medical information in the form of test results from biochemical testing companies.  We use this information in order to provide you with direct healthcare.  This means that the legal basis of our holding your personal data is for legitimate interest.

                <p>
                    We may obtain sensitive information from other healthcare providers.  The provision of this information is subject to you giving us your express consent. If we do not receive this consent from you, we will not be able to coordinate your healthcare with that provided by other providers which means the healthcare provided by us may be less effective.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong class="highlight">3.	How we use your personal data</strong>
                </p><p>
                    We act as a data controller for use of your personal data to provide direct healthcare.  We also act as a controller and processor in regard to the processing of your data from third parties such as testing companies and other healthcare providers.  We act as a data controller and processor in regard to the processing of credit card and online payments.
                </p><p>
                    We undertake at all times to protect your personal data, including any health and contact details, in a manner which is consistent with our duty of professional confidence and the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) concerning data protection.  We will also take reasonable security measures to protect your personal data storage.
                </p><p>
                    We may use your personal data where there is an overriding public interest in using the information e.g. in order to safeguard an individual, or to prevent a serious crime.  Also where there is a legal requirement such as a formal court order. We may use your data for marketing purposes such as newsletters but this would be subject to you giving us your express consent.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong class="highlight">4.	Do you share my information with other organisations?</strong>
                </p><p>
                    We will keep information about you confidential.  We will only disclose your information with other third parties with your express consent with the exception of the following categories of third parties:
                    <ul>

                        <li>Any contractors and advisors that provide a service to us or act as our agents on the understanding that they keep the information confidential</li>
                        <li>Anyone to whom we may transfer our rights and duties under any agreement we have with you</li>
                        <li>Any legal or crime prevention agencies and/or to satisfy any regulatory request if we have a duty to do so or if the law allows us to do so</li>
                    </ul>
                </p><p>
                    We may share your information with supplement companies and biochemical testing companies as part of providing you with direct healthcare.  We will not include any sensitive information
                </p><p>
                    We will seek your express consent before sharing your information with your GP or other healthcare providers.  However, if we believe that your life is in danger then we may pass your information onto an appropriate authority (such as the police, social services in the case of a child or vulnerable adult, or GP in case of self-harm) using the legal basis of vital interests.
                </p><p>
                    We may share your case history in an anonymised form with our peers for the purpose of professional development.

                    </ul>
                </p><p>

                    <strong class="highlight">6.	What safeguards are in place to ensure data that identifies me is secure?</strong>
                </p><p>
                    We only use information that may identify you in accordance with GDPR. This requires us to process personal data only if there is a legitimate basis for doing so and that any processing must be fair and lawful.
                </p><p>
                    Within the health sector, we also have to follow the common law duty of confidence, which means that where identifiable information about you has been given in confidence, it should be treated as confidential and only shared for the purpose of providing direct healthcare. We will protect your information, inform you of how your information will be used, and allow you to decide if and how your information can be shared.
                </p><p>
                    We also ensure the information we hold is kept in secure locations, restrict access to information to authorised personnel only, protect personal and confidential information held on equipment such as laptops with encryption (which masks data so that unauthorised users cannot see or make sense of it). We ensure external data processors that support us are legally and contractually bound to operate and prove security arrangements are in place where data that could or does identify a person are processed.
